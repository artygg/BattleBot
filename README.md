# BatleBot Stage 3 (Physical maze)

# Group members : Artem, Ekaterina 

The control system for the robot is created to carry out specific tasks while following a variety of important functions.

The main features include basic movement abilities like moving forward and backward, turning left and right and completing a full 360 degree rotation. Moreover, the system incorporates line sensors for precise path tracking and distance sensors to identify and maneuver around obstacles. The gripper function allows the robot to grasp and release items as needed. The navigation process starts from the black parking area, follows the black line with line sensors, grasps a cup using the gripper, then successfully navigates through a maze to reach the exit without any hitches.

The system's notable aspects are its reliability and durability. The programming is set up to ensure consistent performance of the robot while being able to recover smoothly from errors or unforeseen circumstances. Safety features are included such as an emergency shutdown option, gradual motor start/stop functions and gentle gripper movements to prevent any damage.

Additionally, the system is built with modularity in mind for easy part replacement or upgrades. This guarantees the robot's long lasting resilience and adaptability to changing needs.

Extra functionalities that improve the system's capabilities include obstacle avoidance mechanisms and efficiency enhancements.
The robot has been designed to steer clear of hitting walls in the maze, stay within the maze boundaries and find the most efficient path. Its agile movement is supported by a steering mechanism that comes in handy when navigating corners and intricate maze layouts.
